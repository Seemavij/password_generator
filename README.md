* Testing:

>Testing is carried out throughout the development of the project.

>This is often done before committing the changes to the repository, where the file is kept. However, sometimes, changes are committed to the repository before rigorous testing is applied, to control changes being made.

> Testing happens immediately after and edits are made where necessary.

> I have carried out testing on the application before and post deployment and have exampled the testing I have carried out post-deployment in the documentation below. 

* Design and Inspiration
>I was inspired to make a password generator and working on a that.

>I learned so much during this course. I was intersted to work on this project.

>Below is the flowchart I created as a guide when I was first visualising how the code would be represented.
