* Testing:

Testing is carried out throughout the development of the project. This is often done before committing the changes to the repository, where the file is kept. However, sometimes, changes are committed to the repository before rigorous testing is applied, to control changes being made. Testing happens immediately after and edits are made where necessary. I have carried out testing on the application before and post deployment and have exampled the testing I have carried out post-deployment in the documentation below.
