>This is a Password Generator Game.

>This will generate password.

>This says Welcome to Paassword Generator.

>This ask Amount of password to generate.

>Than input your password length.

>Than you will get password and it shows here is your password.

* Testing:

>Testing is carried out throughout the development of the project.

>This is often done before committing the changes to the repository, where the file is kept. However, sometimes, changes are committed to the repository before rigorous testing is applied, to control changes being made.

>Testing happens immediately after and edits are made where necessary.

>I have carried out testing on the application before and post deployment and have exampled the testing I have carried out post-deployment in the documentation below.

* Design and Inspiration

>I was inspired to make a password generator and working on a that.

>I learned so much during this course. I was intersted to work on this project.

>Below is the flowchart I created as a guide when I was first visualising how the code would be represented.

* Flow Chart:

* How To Use:
>Password Generator is a terminal based data input application. The steps are simple to follow and the user is guided through the prompts in the terminal. Through the progression of the app, the user will go through the following:

* Testing
>CI PEP8 Python Linter.
>I checked all of my Python code through the Code Institute Python Linter, which came back all clear and attached screenshot.

 * Python Libraries Used and Why?

>gspread: I used gspread to access Google spreadsheets, where the data is being stored for this application. It is a library with useful data manipulation functions and allows us to access Google Sheets.But I did not put any data in spreadsheet as per as my mentor advised spreadsheet is not necessary but I attached spreadsheet and mention comment.

>google-auth: I used the Google Auth library to handle the Credentials for the API calls between the application and google sheets.

>Random: The random module in Python is a built-in module that can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers for various distributions. The module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions. For integers, there is uniform selection from a range.

>string: Strings are used at a larger scale i.e. for a wide areas of operations such as storing and manipulating text data, representing names, addresses, and other types of data that can be represented as text. Python has a rich set of string methods that allow you to manipulate and Drawbacks
of String in Python.
